## Notebook Summaries

#### ***Reviewing the Prompt***
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.

Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently
doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

### [Evaluating The Box Office](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/Evaluating%20The%20Box%20Office.ipynb)
#### ***Important Questions to Answer***<br/>
Firstly, before even evaluating how to produce great content, we must make sure the movie industry is showing healthy economic fundamentals. To evaluate if the movie industry is a healthy industry we will aim to answer the questions proposed in the beginning of this notebook.

#### ***1. Are ticket sales growing since 2000?***<br/>
[Figure 1.1](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%20%201.0.png) answers this question pretty plainly looking at the blue line representing ticket sales. Ticket sales shows an unicumbered picture of the demand for the movies created that year. From 2000 to 2015 ticket sales were not growing until a crazy spike going around 2018. Ticket sales after 2019 have declined dramatically after an impressive 2018 back to the same levels they were at the entire 2 decades we evaluated. However, when we look at a per movie basis in [Figure 2.1](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%202.1.png) we can see that there is growth of about $15 million dollars in ticket sales per movie. However, When you take inflation into account $1 in 2000 is worth $1.50 today. Since our growth in ticket sales per movie was less than the 50% increase in inflation ticket sales have actually dropped.  ***There is no measurable growth in demand from 2000 to 2019.***

#### ***2. Are movies making more or less profit since 2000?***<br/>
This question is easily answerable looking at [Figure 1.1](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%20%201.0.png), [Figure 2.2](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%202.2.png), and [Figure 3.0](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%203.0.png). Looking at [Figure 2.2](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%202.2.png) we see the relationship of profit per movie over time with a line of best fit plotted showing the trend. The slope is flat to barely negative. [Figure 3.0](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%203.0.png) shows the correlation coefficient between profit per movie and the year it was released is -0.17. This also shows there is a negligible negative correlation to the year it was released and the profit of the movie. ***This shows that movies are not becoming more profitable over time.***


#### ***3. Are movies getting more expensive to make since 2000?***<br/>
Similarly to question 2 lets look at [Figure 2.1](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%202.1.png) and [Figure 3.0](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%203.0.png). [Figure 2.1](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%202.1.png) shows production budgets per movie over time. The line of best fit is showing a steep ascent which means that productions budgets have been growing as the years passed. [Figure 3.0](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%203.0.png) shows the correlation coefficient between these two variables is 0.64. This is proof of a strong positive correlation of these values as the years go on the production budgets also increase. ***This shows that movies are becoming increasingly expensive to make over time.***


#### ***4. Does a larger production budget increase your chances of producing a profitable movie?*** <br/>
[Figure 3.0](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/figureImages/Figure%203.0.png) measures the correlation between multiple variables including production budget and profit per movie and ROI. The values for production budget vs profit is 0.055 and production budget vs ROI is -0.14. This means that while production budget does have a little effect on ticket sales the increased cost in the budget is greater therefore hurting your return metrics. ***This shows that a larger production budget has no change to your profit and actually will hurt your return metrics.***

#### ***Conclusion***
In summary, on this data **I would not recommend entering the movie industry as an inexperienced content creator.** The majority of movies are not doing well and there is an extremely wide range in possible outcomes. That being said, I believe this data is leaving out a major part of the revenue stream for movies in the on demand market. If we had data on the income generated from on demand services such as Netflix it may shed a much more positive light on becoming a content creator.

### [Release Date Optimization](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/Release%20Date%20Optimization.ipynb)
#### ***1. What is the best day/month to release movies vs popularity/domestic gross ticket sales?***
Try to release movies on a **Friday** so that more people will come and watch the movie which will drive up ticket sales as compared to other days. We have found out that **December** by far is the most popular and profitable month for movies to be released as compared to other months. So try to release movies in the **October to December** range of months.

### [Runtime Optimization for Popularity or Profit](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/Runtime%20Optimization%20for%20Popularity%20or%20Profit.ipynb)
#### ***2. Is there a relationship of run time of movies vs domestic gross, popularity and production budget?***
It seems that the **highest grossing** movies average to be around **123 minutes** while the **lowest grossing movies** average around the **95 minute** mark. The **most popular movies** in the **top 100 movies** have a runtime of **149 minutes**.
If we take into consideration the most popular movies like Titanic, Avatar, All Marvel movies, this is what we would expect. As per our numbers, people normally like longer movies. Also as we can see in the heatmap that the correlation coefficient of runtime to production budget is positively correlated and is **0.31** which is moderately strong.

Make movies averaging the **120-150 minutes range** and keep in mind that one of the factors that will make **production budget will increase as the movie runtime increases.**


### [Genre Optimization](https://github.com/bsamaha/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320/blob/master/Heather's%20Final%20Notebook.ipynb)

#### ***1. What is the top overall movie genre?***
Out of the top 100 domestic gross movies over the past 30 years, the genre **'Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi'** made up the largest successful genre group in that data sample.

#### ***2.Is there a correlation between release month and higher profitability in that genre?***
Our findings showed that releasing **'Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi' movies in late Spring/early-mid Summer, Spring Break week, during the holidays**, and if it is a **cultural movie, released during that culture's Heritage month,** all proved to be the most profitable times of the year to release that genre.

#### ***3. Is there a correlation between production budget and net profits in the that genre?***
Sticking to a production budget of **200 million dollars while producing an 'Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi' movie has proven to be the key ingredient to high net profitability** that can be forecasted to be between **200-500 million dollars profit.**

### Future Work - If I had more time
If I had much more time I would love to do two different things.
  1. Further Optimization correlations to reduce costs
    - Which genres are the cheapest to make?
    - Are experience directors and actors really need to make money?
    - Evaluate box office sucess of inexperienced movie studios
  2. Evaluate the revenue geerated from streaming services such as Netflix
    - A big portion of the revenue is missing from film studios by only looking at box office data. I would like to see what the total revenue streams of this business is
    - Adding in inflation data to this to see what the true box office dolllars are to get a better look at ticket sale dollars over the years
